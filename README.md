## Hello

I’m a software engineer based in the UK who builds things for the web.

Right now, I’m really into React, contract testing, and API design. Most recently, I wrote about [using React to build Chrome extensions](https://davidgoss.co/blog/react-apps-as-chrome-extensions/). There are [other posts](https://davidgoss.co/blog) too.

In open source, I’m a maintainer of [cucumber-js](https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber-js) and [liquibase-linter](https://github.com/whiteclarkegroup/liquibase-linter).
