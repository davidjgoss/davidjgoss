### Hello

Iâ€™m a full-stack software developer based in the UK. I like to build things.

Right now, Iâ€™m really into Web Components, API design, and React. Most recently, I wrote about [richer API documentation](https://davidgoss.co/blog/api-documentation-redoc-docusaurus/). There are [other posts](https://davidgoss.co/blog) too.

In open source world, Iâ€™m a regular contributor to [cucumber-js](https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber-js) and a maintainer of [liquibase-linter](https://github.com/whiteclarkegroup/liquibase-linter).
