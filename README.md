### Hello

I’m a software engineer based in the UK. I like to build things.

Right now, I’m really into Web Components, API design, and React. Most recently, I wrote about [using CSS functions for adaptive headings](https://davidgoss.co/blog/adaptive-headlines-with-css-functions/). There are [other posts](https://davidgoss.co/blog) too.

In open source world, I’m a a maintainer of [cucumber-js](https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber-js) and [liquibase-linter](https://github.com/whiteclarkegroup/liquibase-linter).
