## Hello

I’m a software engineer based in the UK who builds things for the web.

Right now, I’m really into React, contract testing, and API design. Most recently, I wrote about [using React to build Chrome extensions](https://davidgoss.co/blog/react-apps-as-chrome-extensions/). There are [other posts](https://davidgoss.co/blog) too.

In open source, I’m a core maintainer of [Cucumber](https://github.com/cucumber).
